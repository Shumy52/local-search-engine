Questions for TA:

- Say I have to search in the DB based on a lot criteria. Path, size, date, modif date, whatever. I also have a query parser where the user can mix-and-match all of these together, searching by any combination of these criteria (so 2^nr criteria posibilities). How do I manage this in the DB side of things? By having a method for each separate criteria (search by path, search by size etc.) I COULD combine the results later on in python, but it would be much more efficient to SQL the thing right away, taking advantage of the all the fancy stuff the DB has to offer. Problem is, the way I'm thinking now, that can't be done, writing a method for each combination. What can I do?
- This fucking sucks.How am I supposed to scale this query language? How in the everloving fuck if I have to write these messy DB methods for everything I do.
